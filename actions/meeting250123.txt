Hand Protocol needs your help with boost power! We just got verified and are ready to show you what we‚Äôve got cooking!
Since inception, we have had the honor to officially work with @Laboso Wambogo(mentor) @Existential Zoomer & @joseacabrerav  to address their immediate needs to make the impact they set out to do.
We‚Äôre only 1 month in and with no funding we managed to build a latrine for Laboso Caring

GP Dev Guild X Space ‚Äì 30 aug 24, fri
Title: Greenpill Dev Guild X Metagame - Learn about community building, product development, and the state of the regen space.
Afo - Format is Past, Present, Future
- How did MetaCartel transform into MetaGame?
@dysbulic
  - The liquidity from MetaPool was distributed to developers, using SourceCred.
  - It ranked the Github activity and scored with PageRank.
  - Kept hitting rate limits, no one is maintaining it, it fell by the wayside.
  - Eventually migrated to Coordinate (Ape).
- ENS provides a username and PFP, and that‚Äôs usually enough for identity. 
  - So the profiling is falling by the wayside.
  - Three people are getting a stipend. I‚Äôm getting around 1k a month.
Afo - dealing with the ebb & flow
@dysbulic - The money is a big part of the equation, even though we‚Äôre idealists
Matt - A lot of what‚Äôs being built is cumulative
@dysbulic - I made some pull requests into Ceramic, trying to get it to work for MetaGame
@dysbulic - There was a separate initiative called QuestChain.
- We‚Äôre in the process of removing the old academy and switching to QuestChain. 
- You would start at the MetaGame academy. 
- I‚Äôve not been the vision behind that at all, I‚Äôve been technical support.
Matt - we had a couple conversations about how to manage the Guild treasury.
- It‚Äôs the stablecoin aspect and diversifying. We have a ton of Arb. 
- An official mandated treasury management system. We‚Äôre in beginning stages.
- In Sept we‚Äôre launching GreenGoods. 
- We‚Äôre going to start doing some workshops, through the GP Network.
  - We‚Äôll record them. [names the workshops in the poll]
Afo - getting people to do attestations.
@dysbulic - we said we‚Äôd get 150 people to complete a Playbook. We paid $5.
- I‚Äôm looking at QuestChain and how they structured their contracts. 
Afo - we need a place to collect.
Matt - how can somebody contribute. If you‚Äôre in the MetaGame Discord. 
- Was working on the Academy Playbook. It‚Äôs a slow start but I‚Äôm bullish on it.
Nansel - working on community onboarding. What we‚Äôre doing on Warpcast. 
- Happy to see where that goes.

GP Dev Guild branding session

These are notes that Afo put on the Miro board in advance:

Creating a strong brand for the Greenpill Dev Guild involves capturing the essence of your mission and values while resonating with your target audience. Here are some thoughts and suggestions for your branding:
Core Themes

    Regeneration and Sustainability: Focus on imagery and messaging that highlight ecological restoration, sustainability, and positive environmental impact.

    Innovation and Technology: Emphasize your cutting-edge approach with elements that reflect blockchain technology, decentralized systems, and forward-thinking development.

    Community and Collaboration: Showcase the community aspect, emphasizing collaboration, inclusivity, and shared goals.


Branding Elements
Logo

    Design: Consider a modern, minimalist design that incorporates natural elements (like leaves or trees) with digital motifs (like blocks or networks).

    Colors: Use earthy tones (greens, browns) combined with tech-oriented colors (blues, greys) to balance nature with technology.

    Typography: Choose a clean, readable font that conveys professionalism and modernity.


Tagline

    Consider taglines that convey your mission succinctly, such as "Building a Sustainable Future" or "Empowering Regenerative Technology."


Visual Style

    Imagery: Use visuals that combine nature with technology, like digital forests, blockchain trees, or network ecosystems.

    Graphics: Include illustrations that depict regeneration cycles, growth, and community collaboration.


Voice and Tone

    Friendly and Inclusive: Ensure your messaging is approachable and encourages community involvement.

    Inspirational and Visionary: Inspire action and innovation with visionary language that communicates your long-term goals and impact.

Channels and Content

    Website and Social Media: Ensure consistency across all platforms with your visual identity and messaging. Highlight success stories, ongoing projects, and community contributions.

    Merchandise: Consider eco-friendly merchandise like reusable products that further communicate your commitment to sustainability.

Engagement

    Partnerships: Highlight partnerships with organizations and initiatives that align with your mission, strengthening credibility and reach.

    Community Involvement: Encourage user-generated content, feedback, and active participation in guild activities.

By aligning your branding with these themes and elements, you can create a cohesive and compelling identity for the Greenpill Dev Guild that resonates with your audience and supports your mission.

- I posted: For Climate Round applicants, Jon West of CCN wrote on Telegram:
  ‚ÄúWe have extended the application deadline until 8/5 23:59 UTC.‚Äù
Grant Ships
- Tom from Knot Studios is on the Tree Tales team, one of the Grant Ships. It‚Äôs a game dealing with deforestation.
  - It‚Äôs a prototype. Interface between players and the impact they‚Äôre making.
  - There‚Äôs a ‚ÄòDigital Forest‚Äô inside the game.
  - Athus Linhares is involved too.
- Afo talked about Cloudlines, Cau√© is a (ship?) operator.
  - Cau√© the token is down but we are bullish, hoping for recovery.
ReFi In Arbitrum grants
- Change, projects now have to be done before the end of August.
- Evan, Julian, and Iawal are working together [on some project]
- Evan: we talked to [Edgy] from Greenpill Nigeria, we‚Äôll focus on tech aspects
- Iawal (btw, is from Nigeria and the same tribe as Afo). Testing edge cases.
- Cau√©: we are still looking for an engineering person, adding to our stack
- Evan: Happy to work with Geen Goods, continue the conversation in the Tg group
Impact Reef
- Stepping into the Optimism ecosystem, they‚Äôve changed the [approach]
- We pivoted the project more towards endorsement
Marketing on Farcaster
- Afo maybe Matt can speak to Luciano about opening up the channel
- Yessil: main goal is to grow the green-pill channel, get more active users.
  - Got more followers, get more attention.
- Yessil will talk with Lao later
Matt: do fill in the LettuceMeet app if you wanna participate in the branding
  https://lettucemeet.com/l/X1ppJ
  https://lu.ma/yh6bejwc
- We‚Äôre still looking for an Engineering Lead [not sure who ‚Äòwe‚Äô is]

GP X Space ‚Äì 26 jul 24, fri

Speakers
  Afo: Favorite tooL is Allo Protocol
  Matt UI369: Fav is GrantShips
  Martsen: publicgoods.ai
  Coi: BD on Dev Guild, fav is Hypercerts, GrantShips
  Izzy: @Decentralized some role at GP network
  bitbeckers.: works on Hypercerts, likes Octant
  Matt S: NYC Chapter, fav is QF
  0xWildhare: Hypercerts
  Nansel: design in Dev Guild, fav Hypercerts
  Boiler (Chris): sweeping floors, operations
  Owocki is there, also Wasabi, many more, 26 in total

Section 1: GrantShips ‚Äì past, present, future
- We all met at DAO House or Haus
- DAOs are effective structural governance systems
- Matt: mission is help DAOs win, e.g. GrantShips
- Afo: current tooling impression
- MattU: despite the promise it‚Äôs really technically challenging, smart contracts
  - Like Hats Protocol, useful for lots of different projects
  - Allo is a huge value add, GrantShips is one of the earlier examples
  - Want to build more but not the centralized monolithic winner mentality
  - We‚Äôre building the end user experience on top of these protocols
- Boiler Chris: became cumbersome when the entire community is making decisions
  - Certain individuals or groups should go ahead, GrantShips follow that idea
  - Give somebody the empowerment to do what they‚Äôre good at, with DAO in bg
- Afo: what were some of the biggest surprises, what can we expect in Round 2
- MattU: we got 90,000 ARB to run the data tests, have our own grants program
  - Suddenly we‚Äôre running a grants program instead of building an app
  - We had to choose a domain to focus on, we settled on gaming
  - Had to get people engaged, that was surprising
  - Needed to find a host, to take us into a sub-community
- Boil: we have our own space coming up
- Afo: what are some future plans for the [missed] protocol (Stem?)
- Boil: we needed something that would work modularly that would plug into app
  - Originally using Joker, doesn‚Äôt allow you to get the votes into your app
  - Then we started with GrantShips, the contracts can be used for diff things
  - That will allow Arb token holders to hold votes when they want to
- MattU: we won two grants and we chose GrantShips
- Coi: thanks for onboarding our ship, really excited about the second round
  - How can we make this matching fund
- Boil: you guys were a really good example, custom version of an All contract
- MattU: next round starts on Monday
- Afo: if you have a gaming project and wann bring it onchain, reach out

Section 2: bitbeckers and what‚Äôs going on with Hypercerts
- Afo: past, present, future
- bitbeckers: Hypercerts came out of an idea at Protocol Labs
  - We put everything on Optimism, then worked with Gitcoin
  - People started creating Hypercerts for Gitcoin Passport and airdrops
  - Realized we needed evaluation
- Afo: what are the updates you‚Äôre working on
- bit: on protocol level not much has changed, needed to update our indexing
  - TheGraph wouldn‚Äôt service our needs, we setup an API
  - Using Tailwind and [something with GM], updated SDK, marketplace SDK
  - Devs get an API, a graph, an SDK
- Afo: what are you doing for indexing?
- Bit: Pounder, we missed the boat, so it‚Äôs a service running an Railway
  - Pounder looks promising, will use it down the line
  - It‚Äôs live on testnet, heading towards the QA period, 1 or 2 weeks
  - You can try testnet.hypercerts.org
- Benjamin Life: asked user oriented questions about schemas and such
- Center for Collaborative Economy @C4CollabEcon: shoutout for the EBF
  - Environmental Benefits Framework, co-create, co-design for interoperability
